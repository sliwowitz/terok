"""Review-lag detection: gate branches ahead of an open MR/PR on the forge.

The gatekeeping failure this catches: the operator reviews agent work in
the gate, opens an MR — and then forgets to push follow-up gate commits,
so CodeRabbit/CI keep reviewing stale code.  The predicate needs no new
state and no mode switch:

    an open MR/PR whose source branch is ``B`` exists on the forge,
    and the gate's ``B`` tip is ahead of the SHA the forge knows.

The open MR *is* the "external review started" signal — before it
exists, gate-ahead is the normal local-review posture and stays silent.
Enumeration intersects two ground truths: the gate's branch heads (the
complete record of what agents published — tasks create and switch
branches freely, so task metadata is never consulted) and the forge's
open MRs, fetched with one API call through the operator's own ``gh`` /
``glab`` login (read-only, host-side; containers never see the forge).

Warnings are lines of text (``!42 border-wave-1 +3``), by design: the
operator resolves the lag from their own checkout, so terok only needs
to make the state impossible to miss, not actionable.
